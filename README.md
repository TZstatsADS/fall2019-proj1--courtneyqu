### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Why Rock Dies in 2010s
+ This project is conducted by Chang Qu (cq2203)

+ Project summary: In this project, I studies on the reason of why Rock music started to die out in 2010s through the analysis of lyrics data from 1970s to 2010s. This project uses the techniques of text mining, analyzed the characteristics of different music genre, and conduct sentiment analysis. The result shows that there are mainly three reasons that Rock dies in 2010s:

+ As a subdivision of Rock, Metal's inappropriate cultures, such as misogynist creates bad influence to Rock
+ Technology development changes the way music produce in 2010s
+ Prevailing Terrorism creates social needs for Pop and Hip Pop music to take place of Rock
